### Description
As part of our ongoing efforts to recruit civilians to further our occupation and eventual utopian society on the nearby planet of Neptune, we are conducting searches in our nearby areas for people of extreme physical fitness, who we hope will, with the help of our technology, be sufficiently strong enough to endure the harsh habitat of the planet. To this end, we are hoping to use some data processing to focus our efforts in the neighbourhood where there is the most amount of fitness-promoting infrastructure already in place. We posit that such areas will also, by nature of necessity, contain very physically fit people.
Concretely, we will be attempting to generalize our analysis of three different datasets - Jeremy will study the number and quality of the nearby courts and rinks. Imaan will study playgrounds in the area. Sodi will study the amount of grade elevation changes, using stairs as indicators.
